    <h1>About The Owners</h1>
     <hr>
    <p>My father bought this property ten years ago and in that time it has been rented to numerous clients and their families
    Before we bought the property it was a small trailer deep in the Taylorsville country side. We later took the time to renovate and have not looked back.
        Today we continue to upgrade the cottage in order to bring the comfort of modern nature to the Carolina country side. If you have
        any questions on please feel free to contact us at (704) 929-6700.</p><!--Prints a statement about the owners and the cottage-->
